# KJOS

KJOS is a free and open-source debloated windows. It is based on Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 IoT LTSC.

## Source Code

If you want to see the KJOS source code, XMLs are available at the root of the project in the `source` folder.
The XMLs files have been generated by [NTLite Software](https://www.ntlite.com/).
Then, import the KJOS preset you just downloaded to see the changes from the Windows Official ISO.
